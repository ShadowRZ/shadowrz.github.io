# Brands (?)

Even though I'm not a company, I think I need to describe my common colors and fonts.

## Colors

My site colors are:

* Background: `#fbcfe8` (`bg-pink-200`)
* Foreground: `#9d174d` (`text-pink-800`)

When on documentation sites, background color can use `#fdf2f8` (`bg-pink-50`) instead.

In dark mode, they are:

* Background: `#500724` (`bg-pink-950`)
* Foreground: `#fbcfe8` (`text-pink-200`)

These colors are taken from [Tailwind CSS Colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors).

**TODO**: Collect other colors.

## Fonts

The only font I consistently uses is [**Jost**](https://indestructibletype.com/Jost.html).

## Icons

I mainly use [Solar](https://solariconset.com) and [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com) as icons.
